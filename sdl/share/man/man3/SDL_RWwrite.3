.TH SDL_RWwrite 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_RWwrite \- Write to an 
.BR SDL_RWops
 data stream\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "size_t SDL_RWwrite(SDL_RWops *context, const void *ptr, size_t size);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function writes exactly
.BR size
bytes from the area pointed at by
.BR ptr
to the stream\[char46] If this fails for any reason, it'll return less than
.BR size
to demonstrate how far the write progressed\[char46] On success, it returns
.BR num
\[char46]

On error, this function still attempts to write as much as possible, so it
might return a positive value less than the requested write size\[char46] If the
function failed to write anything and there was an actual error, it will
return -1\[char46] For streams that support non-blocking operation, if nothing was
written because it would require blocking, this function returns -2 to
distinguish that this is not an error and the caller can try again later\[char46]


.BR SDL_RWwrite
 is actually a function wrapper that calls the

.BR SDL_RWops
's
.BR write
method appropriately, to simplify
application development\[char46]

It is an error to specify a negative
.BR size
, but this parameter is signed
so you definitely cannot overflow the return value on a successful run with
enormous amounts of data\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I context
a pointer to an 
.BR SDL_RWops
 structure
.TP
.I ptr
a pointer to a buffer containing data to write
.TP
.I size
the number of bytes to write
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of bytes written, which will be less than
.BR num
on
error; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
