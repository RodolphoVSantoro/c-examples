.TH SDL_RWFromConstMem 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_RWFromConstMem \- Use this function to prepare a read-only memory buffer for use with RWops\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_RWops* SDL_RWFromConstMem(const void *mem, size_t size);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function sets up an 
.BR SDL_RWops
 struct based on a memory
area of a certain size\[char46] It assumes the memory area is not writable\[char46]

Attempting to write to this RWops stream will report an error without
writing to the memory buffer\[char46]

This memory buffer is not copied by the RWops; the pointer you provide must
remain valid until you close the stream\[char46] Closing the stream will not free
the original buffer\[char46]

If you need to write to a memory buffer, you should use

.BR SDL_RWFromMem
() with a writable buffer of memory instead\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mem
a pointer to a read-only buffer to feed an 
.BR SDL_RWops
 stream
.TP
.I size
the buffer size, in bytes
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a pointer to a new 
.BR SDL_RWops
 structure, or NULL if it
fails; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
