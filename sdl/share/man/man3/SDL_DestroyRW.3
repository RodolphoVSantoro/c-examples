.SH NAME
SDL_DestroyRW \- Use this function to free an 
.BR SDL_RWops
 structure allocated by 
.BR SDL_CreateRW
()\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void SDL_DestroyRW(SDL_RWops *context);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Applications do not need to use this function unless they are providing
their own 
.BR SDL_RWops
 implementation\[char46] If you just need an

.BR SDL_RWops
 to read/write a common data source, you should use
the built-in implementations in SDL, like

.BR SDL_RWFromFile
() or 
.BR SDL_RWFromMem
(),
etc, and call the
.B close
method on those 
.BR SDL_RWops
 pointers
when you are done with them\[char46]

Only use 
.BR SDL_DestroyRW
() on pointers returned by

.BR SDL_CreateRW
()\[char46] The pointer is invalid as soon as this
function returns\[char46] Any extra memory allocated during creation of the

.BR SDL_RWops
 is not freed by 
.BR SDL_DestroyRW
();
the programmer must be responsible for managing that memory in their
.B close
method\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I context
the 
.BR SDL_RWops
 structure to be freed
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
