.TH SDL_CreateRW 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_CreateRW \- Use this function to allocate an empty, unpopulated 
.BR SDL_RWops
 structure\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_RWops* SDL_CreateRW(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Applications do not need to use this function unless they are providing
their own 
.BR SDL_RWops
 implementation\[char46] If you just need an

.BR SDL_RWops
 to read/write a common data source, you should use
the built-in implementations in SDL, like

.BR SDL_RWFromFile
() or 
.BR SDL_RWFromMem
(),
etc\[char46]

You must free the returned pointer with 
.BR SDL_DestroyRW
()\[char46]
Depending on your operating system and compiler, there may be a difference
between the malloc() and free() your program uses and the versions SDL
calls internally\[char46] Trying to mix the two can cause crashing such as
segmentation faults\[char46] Since all 
.BR SDL_RWops
 must free themselves
when their
.B close
method is called, all 
.BR SDL_RWops
 must be
allocated through this function, so they can all be freed correctly with

.BR SDL_DestroyRW
()\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a pointer to the allocated memory on success, or NULL on failure;
call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
