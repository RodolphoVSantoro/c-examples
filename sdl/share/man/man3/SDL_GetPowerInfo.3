.TH SDL_GetPowerInfo 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_GetPowerInfo \- Get the current power supply details\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_PowerState SDL_GetPowerInfo(int *seconds, int *percent);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You should never take a battery status as absolute truth\[char46] Batteries
(especially failing batteries) are delicate hardware, and the values
reported here are best estimates based on what that hardware reports\[char46] It's
not uncommon for older batteries to lose stored power much faster than it
reports, or completely drain when reporting it has 20 percent left, etc\[char46]

Battery status can change at any time; if you are concerned with power
state, you should call this function frequently, and perhaps ignore changes
until they seem to be stable for a few seconds\[char46]

It's possible a platform can only report battery percentage or time left
but not both\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I seconds
seconds of battery life left, you can pass a NULL here if you don't care, will return -1 if we can't determine a value, or we're not running on a battery
.TP
.I percent
percentage of battery life left, between 0 and 100, you can pass a NULL here if you don't care, will return -1 if we can't determine a value, or we're not running on a battery
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns an 
.BR SDL_PowerState
 enum representing the current
battery state\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
